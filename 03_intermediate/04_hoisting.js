// Global Context and Execution Context

// Global Context=> Collects the information about anything and everything. It's on top of Execution Context

// Execution Context=> kicks in when you want to run some code (maybe one line of code or totally a whole function)
// After execution of code, it goes away.

// Execution Context=> 
// Variable Object 
// Scope Chain
// this 

// 2 Rules to follow whenever there is Execution Context
// 1]Function Declarations are scanned and made available
// 2]Variable Declarations are scanned and made undefined
