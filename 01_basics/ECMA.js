//  ECMAscript

// ECMA - European Computer Manufacturing Association Script

// For all the browsers to support many different scripting languages it became a tedious task.

// This is where ECMAscript came into the picture.

// It wrote guidelines/standards to follow for all the scripting languages out there.

// Javascript is one these Languages that follow such guidelines.

// ES6 release made a drastic change in the world of Javascript
// ES6 - 2015
// ES8 - 2017

// A lot more versions futher came up...
